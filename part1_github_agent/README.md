Part 1 â€“ GitHub Agent

This agent reads a list of GitHub developers and analyzes their repository activity trends.

### Quickstart
1. Ensure Python 3.9+ is available.
2. Optional: export a GitHub token for higher rate limits:
```bash
export GITHUB_TOKEN=ghp_your_token_here
```
3. Run the agent:
```bash
python part1_github_agent/github_agent.py --input part1_github_agent/developers.csv --out part1_github_agent/outputs
```

Outputs will be written under `part1_github_agent/outputs/`:
- `<username>.json`: per-developer detailed report
- `summary.csv`: aggregate metrics across all developers

CLI Options
```bash
python part1_github_agent/github_agent.py \
  --input part1_github_agent/developers.csv \
  --out part1_github_agent/outputs \
  [--token "$GITHUB_TOKEN"] \
  [--since-days 90]
```

Notes
- No external dependencies required; uses Python stdlib HTTP client.
- If you see rate-limit messages, provide a token via `--token` or `GITHUB_TOKEN`.

### What it does
- Fetches owner repos via GitHub API with pagination.
- Normalizes repo fields and computes: repo_count, total stars/forks, languages distribution, last updated/pushed timestamps, updates in last 30/90 days, and a monthly update timeline.
- Writes per-developer JSON and an aggregate `summary.csv`. Each run includes a fresh `integrity_token`.

### Why these choices
- Simplicity and reliability for interview contexts (stdlib-only, deterministic).
- Metadata-level signals cover the bulk of activity insights without expensive crawl of commits/issues.
- Optional token and backoff to respect rate limits.

### How to present
- Run the CLI; open `outputs/summary.csv` and point out: repo_count, recent activity, languages.
- Open one `<username>.json` to show the schema and integrity_token.
- Mention trade-offs and possible extensions (commit velocity, PR/issue activity, caching, async requests).

### Trade-offs & extensions
- Avoids deep commit history to stay within rate/time limits.
- Extensions: add commit counts via `contributors`/`commits` endpoints, time-bounded queries, and storage.
